Hello. My name is Joe Davini and I am a 27 year old college graduate who is looking to become a software engineer. I love all things about technology and have been trying to teach myself how to code for awhile now but have never been able to stay consisten. Now with Coding Dojo I hope that happens and I can fulfill my dreams!
